# ClickHouse Blog: Sending Windows Event Logs to ClickHouse With Fluent Bit

`This repo contains all material that is discussed in the ClickHouse blog about Sending your Windows event logs To ClickHouse with Fluent Bit`

Inspired by a [Calyptia Nginx blog](https://clickhouse.com/blog/nginx-logs-to-clickhouse-fluent-bit) I continued on the series of Observability with Fluent Bit and ClickHouse.

In this guest post with ClickHouse, we explain the basics of Windows Event Logs, learn about detecting security threats with Sysmon events and start collecting, process and insert logs with Fluent Bit into ClickHouse Cloud. As bonus we look into open source tools like SysmonSimulator, lignator and goeventgen to simulate event streams and catch metrics in a Grafana dashboard.
